# Marketing Analytics - Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis
### Introduction

This project aimed to understand consumer behavior and preferences through choice-based conjoint data on food products labeled as "genetically modified". The study included attributes and levels, and a fractional factorial design was used to develop 9 profiles evaluated by 109 consumers.

### Analysis

The analysis began with a binary logit model of consumer choice, where the estimated parameters showed the impact of each attribute on consumer preferences. The derived importance of each attribute was computed, and the dollar value of different products was estimated relative to each other.

Next, the logit rule was used to compute the share of respondents predicted to choose each option in a hypothetical market scenario with four products and a "None" option.

### Research Question

The research question posed was "What happens to the share of Farm Raised Salmon (Product 4) if it becomes Farm Raised and Genetically Modified (still priced at $13.99)?".

### Results

The results showed that if Product 4 becomes Farm Raised and Genetically Modified, the share of Product 4 would decrease by 7% (from 11% market share to 4% market share).

In addition, the project predicted the product shares when the price of Product 3 (Wild Salmon) varies from $13.99 to $19.99 in increments of $3.00. The own and cross-price elasticities of the product shares were computed, indicating that when Product 3's price goes up by 35%, its market share drops by 38%.

### Conclusion

The conclusion of the project highlighted the limitations of assuming consumer homogeneity and perfect substitution between products, as seen in the unusual pattern of price competition. Overall, the project provided insights into consumer behavior and preferences towards genetically modified food products.
