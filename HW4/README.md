# Marketing Analytics - Market Response Modeling

### Introduction

This project is an individual assignment completed for Marketing Analytics I course to analyze the impact of promotional advertising on demand and sales. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of in-store product demonstrations on sales and profitability for GoodBelly, a Colorado-based company that produces probiotic juice products.

### Problem Statement

GoodBelly has collected sales data from two regions, Rocky Mountain (RM) and Northeast (NE), and wants to investigate the effect of in-store demonstrations that took place between May and July 2010 in certain regions of Whole Foods. The collected data includes information such as units sold, retail price, and binary codes for demonstration and demo1-3.

### Analysis

For each region, a sales response model was estimated separately. The analysis found that sales decrease as price increases, and consumers are more price sensitive in the RM region than the NE region. When a store has a demo or had a demo in the last three weeks, sales increase, and demos have a larger positive effect on sales in the RM region.

A pooled model was estimated by combining the RM and NE regions into a single model. The pooled model demonstrated that when a store has a demo or had a demo in the last three weeks, sales increase.

Interaction variables were created to determine whether the price coefficient and demo/demo1-3 coefficients are statistically different across regions. Model 2 was selected as the best fit.

### Conclusion

Based on the findings, a model was used to test for an effect of running demos in all stores in the RM and NE markets for the week of July 20, 2010. Assuming retail and manufacturer margins, the expected profits for GoodBelly were $39,175.77.

The dynamic demo effects were found to be relatively important in the weeks subsequent to a promotion. Without the dynamic/lagged effects, the aggregate profit estimate (total for all four weeks) would be $4,551.04 lower.
